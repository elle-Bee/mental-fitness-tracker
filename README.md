This project focuses on predicting the prevalence of mental health disorders worldwide through linear regression analysis. Two CSV files containing data on mental and substance use as a share of disease and prevalence rates of specific mental health disorders are merged and preprocessed. 

Data visualization techniques are utilized to understand correlations and patterns.
 A linear regression model is then developed and trained to predict mental health prevalence. The model's accuracy is evaluated, and its performance is assessed on both training and testing datasets. Users can interact with the model to obtain personalized predictions for their mental health status based on self-reported information. 
 
The project's outcomes aim to provide valuable insights and evidence-based recommendations for addressing mental health challenges globally.
